I created a dynamic HR Dashboard in Tableau that provides key insights into employee data. 
The dashboard tracks KPIs like hired and terminated employees, and includes interactive filters and graphs based on demographics, branches, education, experience, and employee performance. 
It enables HR teams to analyse trends, identify skill gaps, and make data-driven decisions with detailed employee information and real-time metrics.
